# How to translate?
- fork this project,
- clone (download) it to your computer,
- create new folder for your translation (check [electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/locales) for list of possible codes â€“ names of the folders),
- copy the lang strings you want to translate from (mostly [lang/en-GB/strings.json](lang/en-GB/strings.json)) to the dir with code of your language you want to translate to,
- publish the strings to your GitHub fork,
- do a Pull Request (here's [random youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSl_qnWO104) how to do that),
- you're done!

# The people that helped me with the app translation:
